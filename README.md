# DDS Package Tool

## 1. Introduction

### Project Description
The **DDS Package Tool** is a desktop application developed in Java for managing and calculating the distribution of packages for different types of substances. The tool allows users to enter quantities of different substances, view them in lists, and calculate the division into packages of specific sizes.

### Project Objectives
- Provide a graphical interface for entering and viewing data about different substances.
- Calculate the distribution into packages of specific sizes based on the entered quantities.
- Facilitate the clearing and modification of entered data.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **IDE:** NetBeans
- **Build System:** Apache Ant

## 2. Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure to have the version of the JDK compatible with the Java version used in the project.
- **NetBeans IDE:** The project has been developed and tested in NetBeans IDE.

### Cloning the Repository
1. Clone the repository using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
    ```

### Installing Dependencies
1. Open the project in NetBeans IDE.
2. The project uses Apache Ant for building, so make sure Ant is installed.
3. In NetBeans, you can build the project directly using the **Build Project** option in the **Run** menu.

### Initial Setup
No additional configuration is required to run the project; just ensure that JDK and NetBeans are correctly installed.

## 3. Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
DDSPackageTool/
├── build/ # Directory generated by Ant for built files
├── src/ # Source code of the project
│ ├── domain/ # Package containing the main class
│ │ └── ddpt.java # Main class that starts the application
│ └── interface/ # Package containing the graphical interface
│ └── MainFrame.java # Class that defines the user interface
├── build.xml # Ant configuration file
└── nbproject/ # Project configuration for NetBeans
```

## 4. Usage

### How to Start the Application
1. Open NetBeans IDE.
2. Load the project.
3. Run the application from NetBeans using the **Run** option.

### Basic Navigation in the Application
- **Select Substance Type:** Use the radio buttons to select the substance type.
- **Add Quantities:** Enter the quantity in the text field and click the **OK** button to add it to the corresponding list.
- **Remove Items:** Select an item in the list and click the **DELETE SELECTED** button to remove it.
- **Clear Data:** Click the **CLEAR** button to empty all lists.
- **Calculate Packages:** Click the **SEND** button to calculate the distribution of packages and display the result in a dialog box.

## 5. Project Components

### Overview
The **DDS Package Tool** is organized into several core components that collectively enable its functionality. Here’s an overview of the main parts:

- **Core Functionality:** The application logic is contained primarily within the `MainFrame` class, which handles user interactions and processes data for package calculations.
- **User Interface:** The `MainFrame` class also manages the graphical user interface, providing the layout and controls for users to input data, view lists, and execute calculations.
- **Build System:** The project uses Apache Ant for building and managing dependencies, ensuring that the application can be compiled and packaged consistently.

Each component plays a crucial role in making the application functional and user-friendly.
